## About

This repo is a holding area for configuration files used to configure/compile Abinit on clusters.
Each configuration file contains a header with metadata in json format followed by
the configure options supported by the Abinit build system.
See files in the [abiconfig/clusters](https://github.com/abinit/abiconfig/tree/master/abiconfig/clusters) directory.

The metadata section contains information such as the list of modules that must be loaded
in order to configure/execute Abinit on the cluster, a brief description of the options activated
and a list of keywords associated to the configuration file.
For further information on the metadata section, see [Contributing](#Contributing) section.

The configuration file can be copied directly from this repository or, alternatively,
one can install the package and use the ``abiconf.py`` script to search for ac files 
by hostname, by keywords. ``abiconf.py`` also provides commands to automate the configuration/make procedure
and generate templates for job scripts (see [Using abiconf.py](#Using_abiconf)).
Contributions from users and sysadmins are welcome.

Note that ``abiconf.py`` is just a collection of configuration files and 
does not aim at becoming a package management tool for Abinit.
If you need a **real package manager** able to support multiple versions 
and configurations of software, consider the following projects:

  * [spack](https://github.com/LLNL/spack)
  * [easybuild](https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild)

Both projects are designed for large supercomputing centers and 
they already provide configuration files to build Abinit.

Pre-compiled versions of Abinit for Linux and MacOSx are also available on the Abinit conda channel:

    $ conda install abinit --channel abinit

These builds are useful especially if you want to try Abinit on your machine but they are not
supposed to be used for high-performance calculations.
For further information, please consult the [abinit channel](https://anaconda.org/abinit).

## Getting abiconfig

<!---
### From pip

The easiest way to install abiconf is to use `pip`, as follows:

    pip install abiconfig
-->

### From github

The developmental version is available at the [github repo](https://github.com/abinit/abiconfig).
Clone the repo with:

    $ git clone https://github.com/abinit/abiconfig.git

After cloning the source, cd to the abiconfig directory and type:

    $ python setup.py install --user

or

    $ sudo python setup.py install

if you have root privileges on the machine.

Please fork the project on github, if you plan to contribute to `abiconfig`.

## Using abiconf.py <a name="Using_abiconf"></a>

Use:

    $ abiconf.py hostname zenobe

to list the configuration files available for the ``zenobe`` machine.
If the machine name is not provided, the full list of configuration files is printed.

Use:

    $ abiconf.py keys intel mkl

to find the configuration files containing the keywords: ``intel`` and ``mkl`` and

    $ abiconf.py keys

to get the full list of keywords.

Once you have found a configuration file for your machine in the 
abiconfig database (e.g. ``manneback-gcc-openmpi.ac``), use:

    $ abiconf.py workon manneback-gcc-openmpi.ac

to create the build directory, then follow the instructions reported on the terminal to configure and
compile the code.

Note that ``workon`` must be executed within an Abinit directory tree containing the ``configure`` script.

It's also possible to generate a submission script template with the syntax:

    $ abiconf.py script manneback-gcc-openmpi.ac

and print the ac file to terminal with:

    $ abiconf.py show manneback-gcc-openmpi.ac

Use 

    $ abiconf.py doc

to get the documentation of the different options.

Use

    $ abiconf.py --help

to get the list of available commands and

    $ abiconf.py command --help

to list the options supported by ``command``.

## Contributing <a name="Contributing"></a>

Fork the repo and add your ac file to the ``clusters`` directory.
Each configuration file must start with a metadata section enclosed between two ``---`` markers.
The text between the markers represents a dictionary in json format followed by the
Abinit configure options in normalized form (remove the initial ``--`` from the option name,
replace ``-`` with ``_``).
Example:

```
#---
#{
#"hostname": "nic4",
#"author": "J. Doe",
#"date": "2016-09-30",
#"description": "Configuration file for nic4. Uses intel compilers, openmpi, mkl (sequential) and external netcdf4/hdf5",
#"keywords": ["linux", "intel", "openmpi", "mkl", "hdf5"],
#"qtype": "slurm",
#"pre_configure": [
#   "module purge",
#   "module load openmpi/1.7.5/intel2013_sp1.1.106",
#   "module load intel/mkl/64/11.1/2013_sp1.1.106",
#   "module load hdf5/1.8.13/openmpi-1.7.5-intel2013_sp1.1.106",
#   "module load netcdf/4.3.2/openmpi-1.7.5-intel2013_sp1.1.106"
# ]
#}
#---

# Abinit configure options in normalized form follows.

#install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
#prefix="~/local/"

# MPI/OpenMP
with_mpi_prefix="${MPI_HOME}"
enable_mpi="yes"
enable_mpi_io="yes"
enable_openmp="no"

# BLAS/LAPACK provided by MKL (dynamic linking)
# See https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor
with_linalg_flavor="mkl"
with_linalg_libs="-L${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_core -lmkl_sequential -lpthread -lm -ldl"
```

If possible, try to avoid hard-coded values e.g. use ``${MKLROOT}`` instead of the full path to the MKL library.
The user is supposed to load the modules defined in the ``pre_configure`` section before running ``configure``
and the modules with automatically set these environment variables.
The big advantage is that one link against a different MKL version by just changing the MKL module
declared in the json dictionary.

The following keywords must be defined in the json dictionary:

  * hostname

    The name of machine (mandatory). Prefer the short version over the long version
    e.g. use `hmem` instead of `hmem.ucl.ac.be`

  * date

    Creation date in the format `yyyy-mm-dd` e.g. `2011-12-24` (mandatory)

  * author

    The author of the configuration file (mandatory).

  * description

    String or list of strings with info about the configuration file (mandatory)

  * keywords

    List of strings with tags associated to the configuration file (mandatory).
    Use `abiconf.py keys` to get the list of keywords already used
    and try to re-use them for new files.

  * pre\_configure

    List of shell commands to be executed before `configure`.
    e.g. commands to load modules required to build/run the executables.
    Optional but highly recommended.

  * post\_configure

    List of shell commands to be executed after `configure`.
    Optional

  * post\_make

    List of shell commands to be executed after `make`.
    Optional

  * qtype:

    String specifying the resource manager used by the cluster e.g. `qtype: "slurm"`.
    Used by `abiconf script` command to generate a submission script template.
    Supported values: `["shell", "slurm", "pbspro", "sge", "moab", "bluegene"]`
    Optional but highly recommended.

  * qkwargs:

    Dictionary with the options that will be used to generate the template for the given `qtype`.
    Optional. `qkwargs` can be used to generate a template script that will work with the
    build specified by the ac file. For example manneback has different Slurm partions
    with nodes belonging to different intel families.
    The build defined in `manneback-gcc-openmpi.ac` is not compatible with the Harpertown/Nehalem nodes
    that must be excluded in the slurm script. To do so, we add:
    ```
        qkwargs": {"exclude": "mb-neh[070,201-212],mb-har[001-014],mb-har[101-116],mb-opt[111-116]"}
    ```
    to the json dictionary. The template generated by `abiconf script manneback-gcc-openmpi-ac` will contain:
    ```
        #SBATCH --exclude=mb-neh[070,201-212],mb-har[001-014],mb-har[101-116],mb-opt[111-116]
    ```
    See `abiconfig.core.qtemplate` for the list of options that can be specified for each `qtype`.
